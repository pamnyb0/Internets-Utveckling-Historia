🌐 Internets Utveckling Historia

Welcome to Internets Utveckling Historia – my personal take on showcasing the history and development of the internet! This project combines my love for design, a bit of experimentation, and a lot of learning about how the web works.

📖 About the Project

This project is hosted on my domain VelkynSpire, which inspired me to design a tiny custom logo that you'll see at the top of the homepage (index.html). It took hours of battling transparency issues with PNG files, but I loved the result! I plan to use this logo across all my future projects if they’re worthy enough.

On this site, I highlight four important contributors to the internet's history:

Tim Berners-Lee

Vint Cerf

Google

Elon Musk

Why? Because more names = more pictures to play with and cool layouts to test! 😊

🎨 Design Details

I experimented with different fonts, but sadly, some just refused to work (you’ll find “sad notes” in the comments of my code to remind myself where I struggled).
The website is simple, responsive, and structured for an easy reading experience.
Fun visual boxes and styling make the key sections pop out.

🔧 How It’s Built
This site was crafted with:

HTML for structure.
CSS for styling, including some design touches.
I’ve commented throughout the code to document my journey – it’s a mix of what worked and what didn’t (future me will appreciate these lessons).

It’s live, and I hope you enjoy browsing it as much as I enjoyed building it!

🚀 What’s Next?
This is just the beginning. I’ll continue improving this project as I learn more about web development. For now, it’s a little piece of my internet history.
